# Axure-NeuLife
Our goal is to improve the current Northeastern Website by adding an active student Forum website by December 2017.     This would help the incoming students, Faculty etc

Problem Statement 

 • Existing /Incoming   students, Faculty and Alumni lack basic information about feedback related to Coursework, Faculty & Professors, transportation, accommodation and living. 
 • Though, this information is available in bits and pieces on different mediums such as Facebook   groups, Emails & text, other websites and smartphone apps.  
 • For Example, the existing  university   portal  provides the information about the  courses  offered   but  does  not  provide   a  student’s perspective about the course  in   terms of the   teaching   content,    future   prospects,    meaningful  learning etc. 
 • The   existing   portal   doesn’t   provide the   incoming    students   a   means to communicate   with existing  students  and  alumni's to  discuss  and  inquire  about  all the above points mention.
 
Goals and Objectives 
 
• No need to look for information at multiple mediums and platforms.  
• Reliable   and   assured   information by authentic users which are validated via their official university ID’s.
• Managed content by moderators/admin to avoid spam and trivial posts.  
• Provides a medium to network, socialize and collaborate   ideas.
